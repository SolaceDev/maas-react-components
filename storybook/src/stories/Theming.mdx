# Theming Your Application with MRC

To theme your application using the supported MRC themes, you can create a theme provider that wraps your application. Below are the steps to achieve this:

## Step 1: Install Required Packages

Ensure you have the `@SolaceDev/maas-react-components` package installed.

```bash
npm install @SolaceDev/maas-react-components
```

## Step 2: Create a Theme Provider

MRC supports a select list of available themes, which include both Solace based themes as well as customer specific themes. The supported themes are:

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Theme Name</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>solace</td>
			<td>Old Solace theme based on the corporate brand colors</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>sap</td>
			<td>SAP theme based on their corportate colors</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>boomi</td>
			<td>Boomi theme based on their corportate colors</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>newSolace</td>
			<td>New Solace theme based on the new corporate palette</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

These themes are defined in the `SupportedThemes` enum within the `supportedThemes.ts` file.

To specify which theme your application will use or to allow your application to switch between these themes, follow these steps:

1. <b>Import the Supported Themes:</b> Ensure you import the SupportedThemes enum and other necessary components from the
   `@SolaceDev/maas-react-components` package.

2. <b>Create the Theme Object:</b> Use the following code snippet to create the theme object based on the supported themes:

```javascript
import { SupportedThemes, createTheme, SolaceTheme, Theme } from '@SolaceDev/maas-react-components';

function getSupportedTheme(): SupportedThemes {
    const desiredTheme = getYourTargetedThemeName(); // custom function to extract the configured or targeted theme name
    let supportedTheme: SupportedThemes = SupportedThemes.solace; // default to the "old" solace theme

    if (desiredTheme?.contains("sap")) {
        supportedTheme = SupportedThemes.sap;
    } else if (desiredTheme?.contains("boomi")) {
        supportedTheme = SupportedThemes.boomi;
    } else if (desiredTheme?.contains("new-solace")) {
        // added this entry for new solace theme in order to test the theme in storybook
        supportedTheme = SupportedThemes.newSolace;
    }

    return supportedTheme;
}

/**
 * Returns the appropriate Solace supported theme.
 * @returns Theme
 */
export function getTheme(): Theme {
    return createTheme(SolaceTheme(getSupportedTheme()));
}
```

3. <b>Configure the Theme Provider:</b> Create a theme provider to wrap your application in. The theme provider should be
   created using the `ThemeProvider` component from `@SolaceDev/maas-react-components` and the theme object created in the
   previous step:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { getTheme } from "./theme";
import { ThemeProvider } from "@SolaceDev/maas-react-components";

export default function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
	return <ThemeProvider theme={getTheme()}>{children}</ThemeProvider>;
}
```

4. <b>Switching Between Themes:</b> To allow your application to change between themes, you can dynamically set the theme
   based on user preferences or application context (`getYourTargetedThemeName()` in step #2 above).

By following these steps, you can easily specify and switch between the supported MRC themes, ensuring a consistent and cohesive look and feel across your application.

## Step 3: Wrap Your Application

Wrap your application with the theme provider you created in Step 2.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ThemeProvider from "./ThemeProvider";

export default function App() {
	return <ThemeProvider>{/* Your application content here */}</ThemeProvider>;
}
```
