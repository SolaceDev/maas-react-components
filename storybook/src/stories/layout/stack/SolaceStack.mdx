`SolaceStack`

<Subtitle>Component Description</Subtitle>

The Solace Stack component is concerned with one-dimensional layouts, providing a flexible way to arrange child elements in either horizontal or vertical directions. It manages spacing between items consistently and handles responsive layout patterns efficiently. This component is ideal for creating linear arrangements of UI elements with consistent spacing and alignment.

The component extends Material-UI's Stack component with Solace-specific styling and defaults, making it easy to create consistent layouts throughout Solace applications while maintaining the flexibility of the underlying MUI Stack component.

<Subtitle>When To Use It</Subtitle>

Use Solace Stack when you need to arrange elements in a single direction (horizontal or vertical) with consistent spacing. This layout pattern is particularly effective for creating organized, linear arrangements of components.

Common use cases include:

- Form layouts where you need to stack input fields vertically with consistent spacing
- Button groups arranged horizontally or vertically with proper spacing between actions
- Card layouts where multiple cards are arranged in rows or columns with uniform gaps
- Navigation items arranged in horizontal or vertical lists with consistent spacing
- Tool palettes or action bars where related controls are grouped together
- Content sections that need to be stacked with predictable spacing patterns
- Responsive layouts that adapt between horizontal and vertical arrangements

<Subtitle>When Not To Use It</Subtitle>

- For two-dimensional layouts with complex grid patterns - use SolaceGrid for grid-based layouts instead
- When you need precise positioning control - use CSS Grid or Flexbox directly for complex positioning
- For overlapping or absolute positioned elements - use positioned containers or custom styling
- When elements need to wrap in multiple directions - consider SolaceGrid with flexible wrapping
- For complex responsive layouts with breakpoint-specific arrangements - use SolaceGrid with responsive props
- When you need elements to fill available space proportionally - use Flexbox properties directly
- For layouts that require custom alignment patterns not supported by Stack - implement custom flex containers
