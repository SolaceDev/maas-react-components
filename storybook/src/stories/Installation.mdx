# MRC Installation & Referencing

This page provides instructions on how to install and reference the MRC (`maas-react-components`) package from your application. The following will guide you on how to set up NPM access and permissions, obtain a GitHub token, and install the MRC package. By following these steps, you will be able to easily incorporate the MRC components into your React based application and leverage their functionality to enhance and expedite your UI development.

## NPM Access & Permissions

Before installing and referencing the MRC package, the following are necessary to ensure proper access and permissions:

- authenticate to GitHub Packages with npm by creating a `.npmrc` file in your project root directory.

```bash
@SolaceDev:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com

//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=GITHUB_TOKEN

legacy-peer-deps=true
```

`GITHUB_TOKEN` needs to be replaced by user specific github token. Make sure the package permissions (write:packages, read:packages) are correctly selected during token creation, and SSO is also enabled.

Use this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to see how to create a github token or more learn about [GitHub package permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages).

## Package Installation

To install the MRC package, run the following command:

```bash
npm install --save @SolaceDev/maas-react-components
```

## Referencing MRC Components

Once the MRC package is installed, you can reference the components in your application as follows:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from "react";

import { SolaceButton } from "@SolaceDev/maas-react-components";

export default function Example() {
	return <SolaceButton />;
}
```
