# Welcome to MRC

MRC (`maaS-react-components`) is a React-based component library that standardizes UI development across projects and applications. Built on [Material UI (MUI)](https://mui.com/), MRC implements our [UX Figma design patterns](https://www.figma.com/design/4Y6nwn19uTNgpxzNAP5Vqe/Patterns?node-id=1694-0&p=f&m=dev) to ensure consistency between design and development.
