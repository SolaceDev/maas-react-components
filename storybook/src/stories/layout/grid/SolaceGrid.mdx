<Subtitle>Component Description</Subtitle>

The Solace Grid component is a flexible, responsive layout system built on Material-UI's Grid component with Solace-specific styling and behavior. It provides a 12-column grid system that automatically adapts to different screen sizes, making it easy to create responsive layouts for dashboards, forms, content areas, and complex UI arrangements.

The component supports both container and item configurations, allowing you to create nested grid structures with proper spacing, alignment, and responsive breakpoints. It integrates seamlessly with the Solace design system while providing the full power of CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts.

<Subtitle>When To Use It</Subtitle>

Use Solace Grid when you need to create structured, responsive layouts within your application. This component is particularly effective for:

- Dashboard layouts with multiple content sections
- Form layouts that need to adapt to different screen sizes
- Card-based interfaces with consistent spacing and alignment
- Content areas that require responsive column arrangements
- Complex page layouts with sidebars, main content, and secondary areas
- Gallery or catalog views with consistent item spacing
- Landing pages with multiple content blocks
- Administrative interfaces with structured data presentation

<Subtitle>When Not To Use It</Subtitle>

- For simple single-column layouts - use Stack or Box components instead
- When you need table-like data presentation - use SolaceTable
- For navigation layouts - use specialized navigation components
- When you need precise pixel-level control - use custom CSS or styled components
- For simple horizontal arrangements - use Stack with direction="row"
- When layout requirements are very basic - standard div elements may be sufficient
- For text-heavy content that flows naturally - use typography components directly
